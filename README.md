# Security Policies for Genval

Welcome to the **security-policies** repository! Here, we house a comprehensive collection of policies designed to enforce security and best practices using Rego, CEL, and CUELANG policies, specifically crafted for use with the **Genval** tool. Our goal is to provide a centralized resource for maintaining security standards across various Infrastructure as Code (IaC) technologies.

## What's Inside?

In this repository, you'll find security policies and best practices tailored for Dockerfiles, Kubernetes, and related technologies. These policies are neatly organized within the `default-policies` directory, with language-specific policies for different technologies nested underneath. You can explore policies written in **Rego**, **CEL**, and **CUELANG** within their respective directories.


Additionally, we've included input templates designed to work seamlessly with **Genval**. These templates are intended for informational purposes, showcasing the required input format and demonstrating various use cases across different `modes` supported by Genval. You can find these input templates in the `input-templates` directory, covering technologies such as **CUE**, **Dockerfiles**, **Kubernetes (k8s)**, and **Terraform**.

## Contributing to Security Policies

We believe in the power of community collaboration. If you identify specific security policies that are missing from our current collection or have ideas for improvements, we invite you to get involved. Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Raise an Issue**: If you have a proposal or wish to discuss potential security policies, please open an issue. This provides a platform for community input and feedback.

2. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: To directly contribute your suggested security policies, submit a pull request. Our community values your expertise and insights, which will further enhance our security measures.

Your contributions play a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of our security policies. Together, we can make a meaningful impact on the security landscape of IaC technologies.

Thank you for being part of our security-focused community!
